disclaimer: ninja2 branch uses a fake local server where I am storing the data. and Create Page also works which does not in ninjaYT branch yet

application uses react and react-router-dom v6

app is deployed [here](https://friendly-feynman-634c7b.netlify.app/) . warning: deployed app will not fetch data unless you start a local port at localhost:8000

playing with my own api which you can check out [here](https://ecomm-products.modus.workers.dev/)

app has multiple pages like home, about, blogs, blogs/:id

to run this app locally you need to run json server too!:

1. `git clone project_ssh_link`
2. inside the project folder `npm install`
3. `npm start`
4. in another terminal `npm run server` this start a new port at 8000 to store the data for the fake server.

happy coding!
