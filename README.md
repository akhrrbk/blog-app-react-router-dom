application uses react and react-router-dom v6

app is deployed [here](https://compassionate-wiles-a4981c.netlify.app/)

playing with my own api which you can check out [here](https://ecomm-products.modus.workers.dev/)

app has multiple pages like home, about, blogs, blogs/:id

to run this app locally:

1. `git clone project_ssh_link`
2. inside the project folder `npm install`
3. `npm start`

happy coding!

disclaimer: ninja2 branch uses a fake local server where I am storing the data. and Create Page also works which does not in ninjaYT branch yet
